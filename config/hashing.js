    | This option specifies which hashing algorithm will be used by default
    | when hashing passwords or other sensitive data in your application.
    | 
    | Supported options:
    | - "bcrypt": Uses the bcrypt algorithm, which is a strong adaptive
    |   hashing function designed for password hashing.
    | - "crypto": Uses the Node.js built-in crypto module for hashing, 
    |   which may use different algorithms (e.g., SHA256). Generally faster,
    |   but less secure for password hashing compared to bcrypt.
    | 
    | You can change this value depending on your security and performance needs.

    | Configuration options for the bcrypt hashing algorithm. The "rounds"
    | option controls the cost factor which influences the time required
    | to compute the hash. Higher rounds increase security but also CPU load.

    | Typical values are between 8 and 12. Adjust this according to your
    | applicationâ€™s performance and security requirements.
